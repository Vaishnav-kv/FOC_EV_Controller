# FOC_EV_Controller

Overview

The FOC_EV_Controller project is a custom motor controller designed for Electric Vehicles (EVs). It seamlessly integrates with the VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller) software, offering a powerful and flexible control solution for various EV applications.

Features

    Custom Hardware Solution: The project introduces a bespoke hardware design tailored to the specific needs of electric vehicles, providing enhanced performance and efficiency.

    VESC Software Compatibility: Retaining the core principles of the VESC project, this controller ensures compatibility with VESC software. Users can leverage the rich features and configurability that VESC offers for optimal motor control.

Repository Structure
1. FOC_EV_Controller_Board

    This repository contains the hardware design and documentation for the custom controller board. Users can find schematics, PCB layouts, and related design files.

2. OpenSource_BLDC_PMSM_Motor

    A separate repository for an open-source BLDC/PMSM motor design that complements the FOC_EV_Controller. This encourages a collaborative approach to motor development.

3. Design Discussions

    Engage in design discussions related to the FOC_EV_Controller project. This includes vehicle controller-motor simulations, Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA), design reviews, and other collaborative efforts.

4. VESC_Software

    A submodule housing the VESC software, ensuring that users can easily access and integrate the latest updates and features from the VESC project.
